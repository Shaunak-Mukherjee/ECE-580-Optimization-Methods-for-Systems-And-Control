#  Optimization Algorithms & Methods for System and Controls

Welcome to my repository for optimization algorithms. This repository contains MATLAB and Python implementations of various optimization algorithms.

## Repository Objective & Content

Sharing my learnings from Purdue ECE58000 course, 'optimization methods for systems and control' which covers fundamental optimization algorithms commonly used in engineering applications. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of optimization algorithms. The codes here include gradient descent, Newton's method, quasi-Newton methods, stochastic optimization, and more.
